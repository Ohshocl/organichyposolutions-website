                    <p>Founded by Brandon O'Neal and Bob Strang, Organic Hyposolutions brings EPA-registered, USDA Certified Organic disinfection technology to businesses and homes across Utah. Our mission is to provide the safest, most effective sanitization available while protecting the environment.</p>
                    
                    <h5 class="fw-bold mt-4">Why HOCl Works</h5>
                    <p>Hypochlorous acid (HOCl) is naturally produced by white blood cells to fight infection. When created commercially through electrolysis, it becomes a powerful EPA-registered disinfectant that maintains exceptional safety standards.</p>
